- VALOSTATS -

ValoStats logs inputted data from Valorant games and calcualtes KDR, Total Kills / Deaths / Assists and
allows you to check specific games, their kills, deaths and assists.

This is probably my first shot of an actually probable and potentially varyingly useful program, so the
code may be a bit messed up.

1 - 'DATA.TXT' is the file which stores all your game data. If you delete this, you will have to set up
     the file again, which will be introduced in a prompt as soon as you relaunch the code. (YOU WILL
     LOSE ALL YOUR GAMES AND THEIR DATA)
    
2 - 'COUNT.TXT' is a file which is not important and does not store anything. DO NOT WRITE IN THIS FILE.
     It will break the program, and force it to not work. If you delete this file, re-run the code and it
     should make a new count file.
     
3 -  You can edit stats within the data.txt file if you do make a mistake or a typo. Do not touch the names of
     'Kills: ', 'Deaths: ', 'Assists: ' or 'Game _'. If you were to change one of these in the data.txt file,
     it likely will not add up to Total Kills, Deaths, Assists or Games, or be able to be selected in the
     MORE tab.
     
Other than that, hope you enjoy.
